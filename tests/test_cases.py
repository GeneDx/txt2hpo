test_case11_text = """Collin et al. (2008) examined 6 affected individuals from 3 families with retinitis pigmentosa, 
    all but 1 of whom displayed characteristic RP abnormalities including night blindness as the initial symptom, 
    retinal bone-spicule pigmentation and attenuated retinal vessels, constriction of visual fields, 
    and a nonrecordable ERG or ERG responses in a rod-cone pattern.
    Two unrelated patients had posterior subcapsular cataracts. 
    The authors observed differences in the photoreceptor dystrophy between the families: 
    in 1 patient from family A, the cones were more severely affected than the rods (cone-rod pattern)
    and kinetic visual fields were not constricted but showed bilateral central scotomas; 
    fundus examination revealed central abnormalities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium 
    and moderate attenuation of retinal vessels. Her 60-year-old brother also had central fundus lesions,
    but his ERG showed neither rod nor cone activity. Family B had relatively late onset of a classic form of RP, 
    with preservation of central vision. The proband in family C, who was the youngest patient in the study, 
    was the only one who was legally blind, due to severely constricted visual fields"
